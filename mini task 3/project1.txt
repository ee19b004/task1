	if yes- check from beginning
		check the bluetooth connection and code
		code shall be checked line by line without ignoring a single punctuation
	if fault- correct it
	if correct - move to next part
		check the dust particle sensor
		check all the connection
		check any short ciruit or circuit break
	if no- bring new sensor or correct the faulty
	if yes- move to next part
		check the relay
		check the connetions
